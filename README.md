# AwaNet Deploy

This repository contains the Render deployment blueprint for **AwaNet**.

It defines two main services:
- **Backend (AwaNet-Backend)**  
  A FastAPI + Uvicorn service running on Python, connected to Supabase and OpenAI APIs.  
  Handles OCR, translation, memory logging, and kaitiaki agent orchestration.

- **Frontend (AwaNet-React)**  
  A React + Vite static site that provides the user interface for interacting with AwaNet.  
  The frontend is built with TailwindCSS and points to the backend API.

## Deployment

This repo uses [Render Blueprints](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) via a `render.yaml` file.  
To deploy:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.  
2. In Render, create a new **Blueprint** service pointing to this repo.  
3. Render will automatically spin up both the backend and frontend services.  
4. Configure environment variables in Renderâ€™s dashboard (Supabase keys, OpenAI key, etc.).  
5. Set up your domain (e.g., `den-of-the-pack.com`) in the Render settings and update Cloudflare DNS.
